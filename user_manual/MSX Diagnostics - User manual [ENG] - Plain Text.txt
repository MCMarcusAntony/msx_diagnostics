1. Running the software
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MSX Diagnostics is available in almost all MSX existing formats, like ROM
cartridge, floppy and tape as physical formats, and in several digital
formats, enabling people to make their own preferred physical copy or run it
in emulators or loading devices, such as flashcards or Gotek devices.
Regardless of the format you choose to run the program, you must hear
3 “beeps” at the same time CAPS led blinks. This indicates that the
preliminary hardware check has been successful and the program is starting
with normality. The program may take a few seconds to perform this first check
and depending on the RAM installed in your system it may take up to 5 seconds.
This preliminary test and feedback are also helpful in ensuring that the MSX
is booting up even without a monitor connected.

 

1.1. Running from cartridge
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Like all other MSX software in cartridge format, just turn off your computer,
insert the cartridge and turn on again. The program will start automatically.
Do not remove or insert the cartridge while the computer is turned on.



1.2. Running from floppy disk
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the program from floppy disk (or from a disk image), insert the disk
and turn on the computer. If you put it in the A: drive, it will run
AUTOEXEC.BAS and start automatically. If you inserted the disk while the
computer was turned on, just type RUN”AUTOEXEC.BAS” then press ENTER.
To run the program from a drive other than A:, just type
BLOAD”B:MSXDIAG.BIN”,R then press ENTER. Replace B: for the drive letter
where you inserted the disk.



1.3 Running from tape
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the program from a tape (or tape image) or audio file like WAV, just
type RUN”CAS:” then press ENTER. Press PLAY in your cassette player or play
the audio file. The 1200 bauds version will take around 3:53 minutes to load,
and the 2400 bauds version around 2:10 minutes.

Regardless of the version you are loading, floppy or tape, you will hear
3 “beeps” and see the CAPS led flashing once the program finishes loading.





2. The main menu
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the boot screen, the program will display the main menu. This menu has
2 pages, showing all available tests and options.
You can move through the options by pressing UP/DOWN on the arrow keys or the
joystick. To run the selected option, simply press the SPACE key or the
joystick* BUTTON 1 (Accept). You can also run a specific option directly by
pressing the assigned number key. To change the menu page, use option “0” on
both pages or just press LEFT/RIGHT on the cursor keys or the joystick.
To exit a test or return from an instruction page, press ESC key or BUTTON 2
on the joystick* (Cancel).

* Works only with the joystick connected in PORT 1.





3.1. SCREEN 0 test.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This test checks the VDP in the SCREEN 0 mode. The screen will fill with all
printable characters. Check for any corrupted character to make sure the VDP
and VRAM work fine in this mode.
By pressing RIGHT/LEFT on the arrow keys or the joystick you can change the
foreground colour, and by pressing UP/DOWN you can change the background
colour. Use SPACE key or joystick BUTTON 1 to restore the default colours.
Use ESC key or joystick BUTTON 2 to exit the test.



3.2. SCREEN 1 test.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is almost the same test as for SCREEN 0 mode, but for SCREEN 1 mode.
The screen will fill with all printable characters. Check for any corrupted
character to make sure the VDP and VRAM work fine in this mode.
By pressing RIGHT/LEFT on the arrow keys or the joystick you can change the
foreground colour, and by pressing UP/DOWN you can change the background
colour. Use SPACE key or joystick BUTTON 1 to change the border colour.
Use ESC key or joystick BUTTON 2 to exit the test.



3.3. SCREEN 2 test.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Like the previous test, this one will check the VDP in the SCREEN 2 mode.
This test will display 4 different images: A pattern with white squares, a
pattern with black squares, colours bars and a sample graphic. Check if all
images are displayed correctly and without any artefact. You can use the
patterns to adjust the geometry of your monitor, centre the screen or adjust
the brightness, contrast, etc.
By pressing RIGHT/LEFT on the arrow keys or the joystick you can change the
image displayed and by pressing UP/DOWN you can change the border colour.
Use ESC key or joystick BUTTON 2 to exit the test.



3.4. SCREEN 3 test.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This test will check the VDP for the SCREEN 3 mode and the special features
of this mode. This test will display 7 different multi-coloured patterns.
Check if every pattern is displayed correctly and without any artefact.
By pressing RIGHT/LEFT on the arrow keys or the joystick you can change the
pattern displayed and by pressing UP/DOWN you can change the border colour.
Use ESC key or joystick BUTTON 2 to exit the test.



3.5. SPRITES test.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This test puts the screen in mode 2 and shows the 32 available sprites with
different attributes, such as colour and position. The sprites use the same
shape to make it easy to determine if any of them have a problem.
At the start of the test all sprites will be placed in a grid. Check if all
sprites have the same shape and if they are aligned correctly. One of the 15
colours of the MSX1 palette, except black, has been assigned to each sprite on
the screen. Pressing SPACE key or joystick BUTTON 1 will start the sprites
bouncing movement. Press again to stop them. You can reset the sprites
positions by pressing UP on the arrow keys or the joystick.
Press ESC key or joystick BUTTON 2 to exit the test.



3.6. MONITOR COLOR test.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This test fills the screen with a solid colour to check the colour quality or
adjust the video output signal. You can choose from WHITE, BLACK, RED, GREEN
and BLUE colours and a LOOPING test with the 15 available colours of the MSX1
palette. A text with the colour name will appear briefly when the colour it’s
selected. Press RIGHT/LEFT on the arrow keys or the joystick to change the
colour displayed. In the looping test, press UP/DOWN on the arrow keys or the
joystick to change the speed. You will hear a “beep” if the speed has changed.
Press ESC key or joystick BUTTON 2 to exit the test.





4.1. KEYBOARD test.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This test enables you to check all the keys of the MSX keyboard. Pressing a
key will display a confirmation text and the key character (if available),
change the foreground and background colour of the screen and make a beep
sound. When you release the key, another confirmation text will appear, the
screen colours will return to the original ones and another beep sound will be
emitted. The colour change and beep sound allow you to test all the keys
without having to look at the screen.
Press “LEFT SHIFT” + “ESC” keys or joystick BUTTON 2 to exit the test.



4.2. JOYSTICK test.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can check any joystick or gamepad connected to both port 1 or 2.
When you move the joystick or the gamepad in any direction or press any
button, it will be highlighted in the graphic on the screen, indicating that
it works fine. If a specific direction or button is not highlighted it means
that the joystick/gamepad has a problem. Please note that this test will also
show an error if the port itself has a problem (broken solders, etc.).
Some non-specific MSX joysticks/gamepads (common not at pin 9, GND) will fail
the test when pressing BUTTON 2, specially in port 2.
Press ESC key or joystick UP + BUTTON 1 to exit the test.



4.3. PSG test.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is one of the most powerful tests included. With this test you can check
in depth the Programmable Sound Generator (PSG) of the MSX. You can assign to
any of the 3 available channels of the PSG a tone with frequencies of 300Hz,
500Hz or 1KHz, change the volume level of each channel or set any channel in
noise generation mode, with the possibility of also configuring the frequency
of the noise. Press UP/DOWN on the arrow keys or the joystick to select an
option and RIGHT/LEFT to change the value. 
Press ESC key or joystick BUTTON 2 to exit the test. Any sound will stop upon
exiting the test.



4.4. MIXED MODE test.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This test checks if the VDP of your MSX is fully compatible with the
undocumented mode by Texas Instruments.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TMS9918#Undocumented

Some MSX models have a “clone” of the official VDP and may not support this
undocumented feature. One of the most know models with this issue it’s the
HX-20 from TOSHIBA. Just run the test and check if the screen is full of text.
If only the upper part fills up, the VDP it’s not compatible.
Press ESC key or joystick BUTTON 2 to exit de test.



4.5. SYSTEM INFORMATION.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This option generates a report with basic information about your MSX, such the
MSX generation, the keyboard language, the amount of RAM and VRAM detected,
the VDP installed in your system and the current refresh rate, also indicating
with a warning sign if it is not running at the original frequency.
In MSX2 and later models with RTC, it will display the current date & time.
If not properly displayed, check if your settings are correct. This report
also shows a table with the current detected RAM layout in SLOTS/SUBSLOTS and
if they are expanded or not. It also indicates which page the RAM is placed on
(numbers) or if it’s MAPPED (squares).
Press SPACE/ESC key or any joystick BUTTON to exit the report. 



4.6. RAM LAYOUT.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This option generates a more accurate report of the RAM installed and detected
in your MSX computer. This report indicates which slot, sub-slot and page is
the RAM placed in and the amount. If the RAM is MAPPED, the report also
indicates the number of pages detected. This report is useful when checking
to see if a RAM upgrade is working or if an external RAM expansion is detected.
Press SPACE/ESC key or any joystick BUTTON to exit the report. 



4.7. REBOOT.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On both page 1 and page 2 of the main menu, you will find the REBOOT option.
When you run this option, your computer will perform a warm reset, erasing the
program from the RAM. If you’re using the cartridge version, the program will
start again automatically.





5. Known issues.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of the publication date of this manual, one of the known issues of
MSX Diagnostics is a minor incompatibility with systems using C-BIOS.
These systems will not correctly display the background colour in some tests
and menus, which makes the MONITOR COLOR test useless.
The rest of the tests works as expected and no other issues are known at this
time with C-BIOS.
Some users using ROM loader devices, such as Carnivore2 with ROM loading
software, have reported that the ROM version does not boot correctly on those
devices. This is not an issue of MSX Diagnostics itself. In such cases, try
running the DISK version of the program.
